# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Been working through <https://freecodecamp.org> . This was logged from the future.

**Thoughts** I've coded for most of my life, on and off though. Always enjoyed it but never stuck with it enough to get good. Now my life is at a crossroads and I want to try pursuing that which I've always loved.

### Day 16: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

- Today I turned my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) 25+5 Clock into an actual project instead of just being on [codepen](https://codepen.io) it's now a real and hosted react app!
- Github is setup with this document and my 25+5 project!
- I also got this document started and updated my log with my previous daily (almost) tweets, with links.

**Thoughts** I'm thinking of trying my hand at React Native with the 25+5 Clock for a start. Just want to keep it simple before I start a bigger project. I should probably also keep tweaking the clock. Always room to improve.

### Day 17: July 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

- Fixed some more bugs in my 25+5 Clock.
- Added local storage for the session and break times, now they are remembered and set when the page loads.
- Started work on the volume control.
- Trying to figure out if I can make a vertical range slider.

**Thoughts** Should I just make a custome control for the volume? Thinking a vertical thumbwheel looking control, maybe I can pull it off. Also looking into drag and drop, want people to be able to add their own sound
files. I don't want to store it in a server or anything though so maybe I can encode them and put in local storage? Maybe a base64 encoding of the file?

### Day 18: July 18, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

- Added volume slider, had to figure out how to make a range slider vertical.
- Started styling the slider. Needs a few more tweaks.

**Thoughts** Trying to do the vertical range input is weird. Having to transform: rotate() has some problems. Takes the width but then uses that for the height after it gets turned 90deg.
I want the container narrow but then the range slider is really short. Workaround seems to be to manually set the height but then I lose responsiveness.

### Day 19: July 19, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

- Refactored my app's styles to styled components, long process even for a simple little app.
- Finally got VSCode and github to work together on my laptop as seamlessly as it's working on my desktop. Not sure what was happening there.
- More research into drag and dropping of files, still have some prep to do before i'm ready to start implementing that though.

**Thoughts**
Liking the styled components. Think it'll work easier than having a 500+ line css file for my app.

- [Today's big commit](https://github.com/CodingJen/25-5-clock-web/commit/6e88dced5e9dfaaaaf3d57f6e43ba770494763e4) - Sure looks colorful in the diff log!

### Day 20: July 20, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
- Working on refactor to react hooks.  Switched over what I though would work but was seriously disappointed.

**Thoughts**
Wish I had just learned the hooks system from the get go, maybe it's better this way, it is forcing me to learn it. I had hoped it would be
easy to convert but after I did things i thought would still work didnt.  I will perservere for a while but I hope I don't have to start over
and do it a small step at a time.

- Nothing today, I'll show it when something is there. It's just a complete mess right now.
