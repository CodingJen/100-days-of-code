# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: July 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Been working through <https://freecodecamp.org> . This was logged from the future.

**Thoughts** I've coded for most of my life, on and off though.  Always enjoyed it but never stuck with it enough to get good.  Now my life is at a crossroads and I want to try pursuing that which I've always loved.

### Day 16: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
- Today I turned my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) 25+5 Clock into an actual project instead of just being on [codepen](https://codepen.io) it's now a real and hosted react app!
- Github is setup with this document and my 25+5 project!
- I also got this document started and updated my log with my previous daily (almost) tweets, with links.

**Thoughts** I'm thinking of trying my hand at React Native with the 25+5 Clock for a start.  Just want to keep it simple before I start a bigger project. I should probably also keep tweaking the clock. Always room to improve.
