## Log

### R1D1 
Probably closer to day 60, but I'll join in officially on day 1!
Currently working on more vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. Switching between that and #freeCodeCamp front end libraries, so I don't get too frustrated with one thing.

### R1D4
Have my  #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer working and passing the tests, but the Marked.js doesn't seem to be rendering properly. Want to figure out what's wrong and refine a bit before moving on.

### R1D5 R1D6
Oops, coded too late after a long day to tweet. But I made my #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer look decent after learning I had to style it myself, lol.

Working on the drum machine. It plays sound just finishing up the controls.

### R1D8 R1D9
Another one done! Starting to get a handle on React. Challenge this time was the calculator logic edge cases, 20% of the work takes about 80% of the time. On to the next!

### R1D10
#freeCodeCamp React 25+5 Timer Done! Styled it nicely I think.  React is fun! Time for some new things for now, need to come back to React and learn the new hooks system.

### R1D12
Finished #freeCodeCamp Data Visualization. I'm sure that's just scratching the surface of what D3 can do. Also worked on an excessive FizzBuzz challenge.
