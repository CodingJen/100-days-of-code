## Log

### R1D1

Probably closer to day 60, but I'll join in officially on day 1!
Currently working on more vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. Switching between that and #freeCodeCamp front end libraries, so I don't get too frustrated with one thing.

### R1D4

Have my #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer working and passing the tests, but the Marked.js doesn't seem to be rendering properly. Want to figure out what's wrong and refine a bit before moving on.

### R1D5 R1D6

Oops, coded too late after a long day to tweet. But I made my #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer look decent after learning I had to style it myself, lol.

Working on the drum machine. It plays sound just finishing up the controls.

Whew, that #freeCodeCamp Drum Machine in React just wanted to challenge me! I got through it though all features working and passing tests! Onward!

### R1D8 R1D9

Another one done! Starting to get a handle on React. Challenge this time was the calculator logic edge cases, 20% of the work takes about 80% of the time. On to the next!

### R1D10

#freeCodeCamp React 25+5 Timer Done! Styled it nicely I think. React is fun! Time for some new things for now, need to come back to React and learn the new hooks system.

### R1D11

Lighter day going through more #javascript30 lessons. Did the localStorage and the text shadow effects. Nothing too difficult. Going to start the #freeCodeCamp Data Visualization lessons tomorrow.

### R1D12

Finished #freeCodeCamp Data Visualization. I'm sure that's just scratching the surface of what D3 can do. Also worked on an excessive FizzBuzz challenge.

Having a bit of a difficult time with D3. I'm sure I'll get get there, just have to fumble along for a bit.

### R1D16

Setup my github finally. Turned my #freeCodeCamp 25+5 Clock project into a proper hosted React app instead of a codepen. Fixed some bugs and refactored a couple things.

### R1D17

Fixed some bugs in my sample project. Added local storage so it remembers your settings. Working on a volume control now and have a couple other plans in the near future, hope I can make them work.

### R1D18

Is there a better way to make a range slider vertical than to transform: rotate() it. Problem is the slider takes the width of the container it's in as it's height after the transform and makes it difficult to place.
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1416887434084716546

### R1D19

Still going! Worked on refactoring my app's styles to styled components. Now I don't have a huge .css file to sift through!

### R1D20

Left my app a mess today! Trying to learn React Hooks by converting from classes. What a disaster! I need a break. Some things are just not updating like I think they should. Time for a break.
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1417598932792668162

### R1D21

So confused. Spent the day trying to debug. useState() state variable don't show updated values in a console.log in a setInterval callback. Making a quick useEffect shows they update however. Anyone able to help?
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1418021934101499904

Extended day.
Done with the (initial) refactor to hooks. Not sure if it's all the way they should be used but it's a start. And it has no warnings now too.

### R1D22

Started planning my next project. It will be fun to see it come together. Hopefully set up the git repo in a better way. Got some boilerplate code setup.

### R1D23

Worked on my new project. It's a small game. I wanted to try it using React, was having some trouble so I started prototyping it on codepen. Got a fair ways into it.
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1418956919406952448

### R1D24

Worked on my vanilla JS/CSS/HTML game. It's starting to actually turn into something. So wonderful to see a blank screen start to come alive!
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1419355047566004225

### R1D25

Have some basic sounds working in my game! Working on refining movement. Thinking about the next steps, but may have to step back and refactor a couple parts first.
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1419497906617282565

### R1D26

Added shooting Pew üî´ sound. Started work on getting emoji's to drop bombs on player. Started on styling logo. Setup cloud hosting for my font and sound files.

### R1D27

Game project is coming along. Keep adding features, and apparently bugs too. üêû ü§£ I'll keep adding and squashing until I'm happy!
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1420174651242680320

### R1D28

Worked on my JavaScript game, Emoji Invaders. Redid my emoji grid, now just creating the elements on the DOM instead of the HTML file. Also made it completely responsive to window resizing. Set up domain and cloud host.
https://twitter.com/CodingJen/status/1420574977380655107

### R1D28

All over the place today. Game code cleanup, brainstorm and prototype how to fix a problem. Work on web host. Node.js tutorials.
